FALSE POSITIVE CAUSES:
=====================

1. PyInstaller Packaging: Common cause of antivirus false positives
2. File Operations: Reading/writing files may trigger heuristic detection
3. Temporary Files: Creating temp files during processing
4. System Resource Access: Accessing fonts and printing services
5. Unsigned Executable: No commercial code signing certificate

VERIFICATION METHODS:
====================

1. Source Code Review: Complete source code available for inspection
2. Build Process: Transparent build process using standard tools
3. Hash Verification: File hashes available for integrity checking
4. Behavioral Analysis: Application behavior is predictable and documented
5. Sandbox Testing: Safe to test in isolated environments

RECOMMENDED ANTIVIRUS ACTIONS:
=============================

1. Whitelist Application: Add to trusted applications list
2. Whitelist Directory: Add installation directory to exclusions
3. Behavioral Monitoring: Monitor for actual malicious behavior (none expected)
4. Regular Rescanning: Periodic verification with updated signatures
